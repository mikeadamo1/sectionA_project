The author criticized the American Colonization Society; addressed the issue of compensation of slaveholders for the price of slaves; condemned churches condoning slavery; and stated that interracial sexual relations were the product of slavery. Issues raised appear to concern the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, particularly the author's anger over the imprisonment of fugitive slaves without trial and the requirement that citizens assist in the return of fugitive slaves.

Addington wrote from Cadiz, Zerbst, Liege, Paris, Zurich, London and Berne. In most of the letters Addington related news and developments in the German campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars. He mentioned prominent political and military figures, including Louis XVIII, Napoleon, Soult, Blucher, Ney, and the Duke of Wellington. The author described the return of King Louis XVIII from exile, the desertion of Allied troops to L'Armee du Nord, and the brave performance of the Swiss soldiers. Addington vehemently expressed his contempt for the people of France and the state of their country, and his admiration for the Swiss. In two passages he described the social behavior of Swiss women.

folder 1		Letter to Ashur Adams	1836 June 23	1836/1836	eng	1 item		Collection comprises a letter written to Ashur Adams in Boston. The letter was composed during the writer's stay in western North Carolina, and was mostly likely written by Adams' son, George Wyllis Adams.

The letter also contains a sketch of the landscape. Other topics include horseback riding, the writer's slight illness, and his concern about the lack of correspondence from family members ("I have been obliged to become quite sociable with my neighbors merely because I am encouraged to talk on paper with none of you.)"
